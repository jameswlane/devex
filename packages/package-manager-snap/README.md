## Experimental limitations

The plugin forwards explicit `install --classic --channel=... <snap>` arguments
unchanged. App-definition options do not currently reach this plugin:
`PluginBasedInstaller.Install` calls `catalogPackageArguments`, which strips
option tokens (including `--classic` and `--channel=...`). There is no separate
Snap option field in the current app type or plugin invocation. Wiring those
options through the CLI is deferred to #163; this plugin is experimental until
that integration exists. Both `update` and `upgrade` run `snap refresh`.
