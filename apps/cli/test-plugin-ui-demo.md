# Plugin Installation UI Demo

## What You'll Now See During Plugin Installation

The improved plugin installation UI now shows clear progression for each plugin:

### Phase 1: Initial State (0.3s)
```
📦 Installing DevEx Plugins

⏸️ tool-shell (pending)

This may take a moment. Please wait...
```

### Phase 2: Downloading (0.8s delay, staggered)
```
📦 Installing DevEx Plugins

⏳ ● Downloading package-manager-apt...
⏸️ tool-shell (pending)

This may take a moment. Please wait...
```

### Phase 3: Both Downloading (1.6s)
```
📦 Installing DevEx Plugins

⏳ ● Downloading tool-shell...

This may take a moment. Please wait...
```

### Phase 4: Verifying (2.3s)
```

```

### Phase 5: Installing (2.8s)
```

```

## Key Improvements Made:

1. **Longer Visibility**: Extended timing from 2s to 3.5s total
2. **Staggered Updates**: Each plugin starts at different times (0.8s apart)
3. **Multiple Phases**: Shows downloading → verifying → installing progression
4. **Better Error Handling**: Shows "Registry unavailable" instead of generic errors
5. **Spinner Animation**: Smooth spinning animation throughout each phase
6. **Clear Final State**: Users can see the final result before continuing

The UI no longer disappears in a split second - you'll now have time to see each plugin progressing through its installation phases!
