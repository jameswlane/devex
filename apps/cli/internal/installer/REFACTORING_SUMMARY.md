## 🔧 Architecture Improvements

### Before (Monolithic)
```
installer.go (1817 lines)
├── Command execution
├── Security validation  
├── Theme management
├── Script handling
├── Package manager logic
├── Output streaming
├── Input handling
└── Performance tracking
```

### After (Modular)
```
installer_refactored.go (387 lines) - Orchestration only
├── executor/ - Command execution + security
├── theme/ - Theme selection + application  
├── script/ - Download + validation + execution
├── security/ - Validation helpers
├── packagemanager/ - PM coordination
└── stream/ - Output handling + logging
```

## 📋 Next Steps

1. **Fix minor test issues**: Stream package compilation
2. **Integration testing**: Test the refactored installer end-to-end
3. **Performance benchmarking**: Compare performance with original
4. **Documentation**: Update API documentation
5. **Migration**: Replace original installer with refactored version

## 🏆 Success Metrics
